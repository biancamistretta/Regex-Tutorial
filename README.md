# Regex Tutorial: Comprehensive Guide to Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. 
In this tutorial, we'll explore various components of regex and how they can be used effectively in different scenarios.

## Summary

This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to regular expressions, covering essential components such as anchors, quantifiers, character classes, etc.
Each section includes explanations and examples to help you understand and apply regex patterns in your projects.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are used to specify positions in the text. 
Some used anchors are`^` for the start of a line and `$` for the end of a line.

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify how many times a character or group can appear in a pattern. 
Examples are `*` (zero or more), `+` (one or more), and `?` (zero or one).

### OR Operator

The OR operator (`|`) allows you to match one of several alternatives in a pattern. 
Example: `mom|dad` will match either "mom" or "dad".

### Character Classes

Character classes allow you to match a single character from a set of characters. 
`[aeiou]` will match any vowel.

### Flags

Flags modify the behavior of regex patterns. 
Common flags are `i` for case-insensitive matching and `g` for global matching.

### Grouping and Capturing

Grouping allows you to treat multiple characters as a single unit. Capturing groups capture the matched text for later use.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions are similar to character classes but provide more flexibility in specifying character ranges. 
Example: `[0-9]` matches any digit.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Regex quantifiers are greedy, meaning they match as much text as possible.
Lazy quantifiers match as little text as possible.

### Boundaries

Boundaries specify positions such as the start or end of a word. 
Some are `\b` for word boundaries and `\B` for non-word boundaries.

### Back-references

Back-references allow you to refer to previously captured groups in your pattern.
Example: `\1` is the first captured group.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead and look-behind assertions allow you to assert whether a pattern is followed or preceded by another pattern without consuming the text.
